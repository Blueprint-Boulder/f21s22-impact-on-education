  <h1>2021-2022 Student Academic Support Fund</h1>
  <h4>In order to adapt and respond to extraordinary student needs and circumstances, especially during the 2021-22 school year, Impact on Education has transitioned Opportunity Fund into Student Academic Support Fund, a pilot program we launched in Fall 2020 (September-December).</h4>
  <h4> This year, with our Critical Needs Fund dollars being used to support large-scale district initiatives including providing home internet to every student in need, continuing food distribution for students facing food insecurity, and plans to address gaps in learning stemming from the school building closures, we know that schools may still face immediate student need for academic support to supplement district plans. Based on feedback from principals and our evaluation of typical Opportunity Fund uses, this Student Academic Support Fund has been created to fulfill individual student needs on a case-by-case basis.
</h4>
<h4>
Some needs we anticipate fulfilling include the following:
</h4>
<h5>
Class fees (lab materials, textbooks, test fees, concurrent enrollment fees, equipment fees for electives etc)
</h5>
<h5>
Technology (computer equipment, connectivity/accessibility, software licenses, adaptive technology etc)
</h5>
<h5>
Supplemental equipment (supplies for individual students)
</h5>
<h5>
Transportation expenses (bus passes, bike repair etc) for students
</h5>
<h5>
Academic tutoring, test prep or other supplemental supports
</h5>
<h5>
Music instrument rental/repair 
</h5>
<h4>
Please use this form/application to assess your need and align it with the most appropriate resource, whether it be Impact on Education or another BVSD or community organization.  Also, remember that we are considering requests ranging from $100 to $1000, and our dates for request consideration are 
</h4>
<h5>
Monday, October 5 (decisions will be made Friday, October 9 EOD)
</h5>
<h5>
Monday, October 19 (decisions will be made Friday, October 23 EOD)
</h5>
<h5>
Monday, November 2  (decisions will be made Friday, November 6 EOD)
</h5>
<h5>
Monday, November 16 (decisions will be made Friday, November 20 EOD).
</h5>
<h5>
NEW! Monday February 8th (decisions shared by Tuesday February 16, 2021)
</h5>
<h4>
We will be asking our community volunteers to read all SASF requests for each deadline and decide if, given the BVSD and community resources available, the need is best fulfilled by IoE or another organization and also if more information is needed for us to fund your request.
</h4>
<h4>
Thank you so much for allowing us to continue our academic support of your students. We know that this year is unlike any other year, and we are striving to fulfill as many student needs as possible, whether via Critical Needs Fund or this pilot, Student Academic Support Fund.
