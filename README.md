# Authentication Page
The HTML file that needs CSS is `templates/accountAccess.html`. The backend isn't finished but that shouldn't matter for the CSS.

The TODO comments were written for my own purposes, so feel free to ignore them.

**IMPORTANT FOR LATER:** (Ignore for now if you're just doing CSS): We cannot use a modified version of this exact Django project as our final project, because SECRET_KEY (in settings.py) is public. We will likely have to make a new project and paste this code over, or figure out a way to modify SECRET_KEY in a way that doesn't break everything.
